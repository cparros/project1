## Getting Started
Brainstorming.
We chose to do a game was to give people a 
chance to work on their blackjack skills, as well as a way to unwind.
Our goal was to create a functioning game to appeal to both skilled players
and casual gamers. 

Api Search.
The next challenge was to find relevant APIs that would create the outcome we
were looking for. We found two that we built the game around. The deck of cards API 
was a necessity for Blackjack to work. The Dicebear random avatar generator provided
animated characters to add to the old school gaming theme.
