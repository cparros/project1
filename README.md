## User Story
As a beginner playing blackjack
I want to improve my skills
So I can win a lot of money in Vegas

As a bored individual
I am looking to pass time playing blackjack
So I can have fun in my free time


## Motivation
The reason we chose to do a game was to give people a 
chance to work on their blackjack skills, as well as a way to unwind.
Our goal was to create a functioning game to appeal to both skilled players
and casual gamers. 

Since we were tasked with using two public API's, the next challenge was to find relevant APIs that would create the outcome we were looking for. We found two that we built the game around. The deck of cards API 
was a necessity for Blackjack to work. The Dicebear random avatar generator provided
animated characters to add to the old school gaming theme.
