## Our Process outline
Brainstorming...
The reason our team chose to do a game was to give people a 
chance to work on their blackjack skills, as well as a way to unwind.
Our goal was to create a functioning game to appeal to both skilled players
and casual gamers. The next step was to identify the resources we could use 
to make the vision come to life.
Api Search...
The next challenge was to find relevant APIs that would create the outcome we
were looking for. *Note to me* Blackjack/Random Face Generator
